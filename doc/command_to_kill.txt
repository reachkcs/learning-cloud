Once you know the PID, you can kill using: SELECT pg_terminate_backend(<pid>);
forcefully using: SELECT pg_cancel_backend(<pid>);
pg_terminate_backend(pid): Immediately kills the process (hard stop).
pg_cancel_backend(pid): Tries to cancel the query but keeps the session alive.

- Kill Multiple Sessions at Once
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE datname = 'your_database' AND usename = 'your_user';
