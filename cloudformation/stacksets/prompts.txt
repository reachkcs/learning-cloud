#give me an example of a stackset that creates 1 VPC, 2 subnets, 2 route tables in two accounts and one transit gateway in one of the account that is used to connect VPCs in both the accounts.
#one VPC should have cidr as 10.191.102.0/23 and the other should be with CIDR 10.191.104.0/23.
#instead of hard coding the CIDRs, put them in SSM parameter store and refer them in the template.
